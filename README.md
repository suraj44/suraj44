### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Suraj, a graduate student at the University of Waterloo. My research involves building a scalable transaction processing storage system that is meant to support a new serverless runtime. I'm really enjoying the challenge of building this system from the ground up and solving problems that come up along the way. 

During my time as an undergrad, I explored different areas of CS: 
- a neural net for a handwritten equation solving application 
- a return oriented programming exploit generation tool targetting executables vulnerable with a buffer overflow
- implementing a queue management algorithm in the network stack of the Linux kernel.

I enjoy reading papers related to distributed systems and operating systems and thinking about potential projects that can build on the ideas that they put forward.
